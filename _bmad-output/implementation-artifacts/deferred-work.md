# Deferred Work Log

## Deferred from: code review of 3-1-news-ingestion-webhook-endpoint (2026-06-22)

- **D1: No authentication on webhook endpoint** — POST /webhooks/news-ingest has no auth header, API key, or shared secret. Any caller can inject content. Intentional MVP decision for internal n8n integration; address in a future security hardening story. `backend/app/routers/webhooks.py:8`
- **D2: In-memory store — data lost on process restart** — All ingested items are lost when the process restarts. Intentional MVP design; persistence (database or queue) is a future epic concern. `backend/app/services/news_store.py`
- **D3: threading.Lock ineffective across multiple worker processes** — Multi-worker deployments (Gunicorn/Uvicorn) each have their own NewsStore instance; duplicate checks are not cross-process safe. Acceptable at MVP single-worker scale; address when adding persistence. `backend/app/services/news_store.py:7`
- **D4: get_by_id O(n) linear scan — no ID index** — No _id_index; GET /news/{id} scans all items. Acceptable at MVP scale; add id index alongside persistence work. `backend/app/services/news_store.py:23-27`
- **D5: get_all shallow-copies list but not dict items** — list(self._items) creates a new list but shares dict references; callers could mutate items. FastAPI serializes immediately so no current exploitable path. Address with typed store objects when adding persistence. `backend/app/services/news_store.py:19-21`
- **D6: AC3 content-hash dedup doesn't index second source_url** — When content-hash dedup fires, the new URL is not added to _url_index. Dedup is still correct (future same-URL request hits content-hash path). Minor gap in future extensibility. `backend/app/services/news_store.py:34-37`
- **D7: KeyError if mock data items lack source_url or content** — __init__ dict comprehensions would raise KeyError on malformed mock data. Controlled internal data makes this impossible in practice. `backend/app/services/news_store.py:9-12`
- **D8: No rate limiting on ingest endpoint** — No throttling per caller or time window. Infrastructure-level concern outside MVP scope. `backend/app/routers/webhooks.py`
- **D9: ingest() accepts plain dict — type safety lost at store boundary** — Pydantic validates at the router boundary; store works with untyped dicts internally. Acceptable for MVP; address when introducing typed domain models with persistence. `backend/app/services/news_store.py:32`

## Deferred from: code review of 2-6-news-feed-page-and-category-filter-bar (2026-06-22)

- **D1: formatTime(error) invalid date risk** — `error: string | null` prop passed to `formatTime()` has no ISO date type constraint; a future caller passing a non-ISO string (e.g. an error message) would render "Invalid Date" in the error banner. Enforce with a branded type or rename the prop to `errorTimestamp`. `NewsFeed.tsx:70`
- **D2: tabRefs.current not cleared on categories prop change** — Stale `HTMLButtonElement` refs at out-of-bounds indices persist when `categories` array shrinks. Currently safe because `CATEGORY_TABS` is a static constant, but a future dynamic prop could cause `focus()` calls on detached DOM nodes. `CategoryFilterBar.tsx:18`
- **D3: isMarketHours() evaluated client-side in "use client" component** — Server and client clocks can differ by seconds, causing React 19 hydration mismatch near 09:00 or 18:00 Bangkok time. Fix by computing staleness server-side and passing the result as a prop, or adding `suppressHydrationWarning`. `NewsFeed.tsx:13`
- **D4: app/page.tsx has no error handling around Promise.all** — Any single API failure (news, overview, ticker) crashes the entire home page to an error boundary. Story 2.6 hardened `news/page.tsx` but the home page was not updated. Address in a dedicated error resilience story. `src/app/page.tsx:11`
- **D5: isMarketHours() ignores weekends** — SET market is Mon–Fri; staleness banner and empty-state copy ("Check back during market hours") can mislead on Saturdays/Sundays. Spec text says "09:00–18:00 Bangkok time" without weekday qualification — resolve the ambiguity before implementing a fix. `NewsFeed.tsx:13`

## Deferred from: code review of 2-5-newscard-component (2026-06-21)

- **D1: `getByRole('link')` in NewsCard test has silent coupling to child component links** — `screen.getByRole('link')` (NewsCard.test.tsx line ~118) throws "Found multiple elements" if SentimentBadge or AIInsightBox ever renders an `<a>` element. Currently safe, but creates invisible brittleness. Resolve by adding `{ name: /เฟด/i }` filter or using `container.querySelector('a')` pattern.
- **D2: `<article>` has no accessible name** — ARIA APG recommends that repeated landmark regions of the same type have distinct labels. NewsCard renders many `<article>` elements in a feed; screen readers cannot distinguish them in landmark navigation. Fix: add `aria-labelledby` pointing to the inner `<h2>` id. Pre-existing from before Story 2.5. Track in Story 2.9 WCAG audit pass.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-4-sentimentbadge-and-aiinsightbox-components (2026-06-21)

- **D1: No runtime defense in SentimentBadge for unknown sentiment values** — `SENTIMENT_STYLES[unexpected]` returns `undefined`; destructuring throws a runtime crash if the API ever sends an unrecognized value (e.g. `"mixed"` or casing mismatch). TypeScript compile-time enforcement is currently the only guard. Add a `?? SENTIMENT_STYLES.neutral` fallback when the component is touched in a future token/cleanup pass.
- **D2: `analysis_at` malformed or empty string → NaN → silent staleness suppression** — `new Date("").getTime()` returns `NaN`; `NaN > 86400000` is `false`, hiding the stale indicator. Pre-existing pattern — no other component validates API string fields. Address at the API boundary (Pydantic response schema) rather than in UI components.
- **D3: Missing `aria-live="polite"` on AIInsightBox container** — Screen readers receive no announcement when the analysis transitions from pending to loaded. Currently moot because the component is a Server Component rendered via ISR — no client-side state transition occurs. If the component is ever refactored to use client-side polling/SWR, add `aria-live="polite"` to the container. Track in Story 2.9 WCAG audit.
- **D4: Clock skew at 24h staleness boundary** — `Date.now()` is the client clock; `analysis_at` originates from the server. A small discrepancy could cause an analysis at exactly 24h to flip between stale/fresh on successive renders. Acceptable edge case for the current financial research use case. Resolve by adding a 5-minute tolerance buffer if this becomes a user-reported issue.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-3-navbar-bottomtabbar-and-layout-foundation (2026-06-21)

- **D1: Hardcoded brand hex instead of Tailwind token** — `Navbar.tsx` and `BottomTabBar.tsx` use `style={{ backgroundColor: "#4A342A" }}` instead of `className="bg-espresso"`. The token exists in `tailwind.config.ts`; colour is visually correct but will diverge from the theme on future token changes. Migrate to `bg-espresso` when doing a broader component token audit.
- **D2: Navbar inactive tab opacity mismatch** — `Navbar.tsx` uses `rgba(255,255,255,0.5)` (50%) for inactive tabs; AC3 for BottomTabBar explicitly specifies 45% (`rgba(255,255,255,0.45)`). Minor visual inconsistency between nav surfaces. Align in a future design-token cleanup pass.
- **D3: Potential z-index collision between BottomTabBar and N8nChat** — Both are `fixed` with `z-50`; the chat widget button could overlap the Trends tab on mobile. Requires checking `N8nChat` component's z-index and position before resolving.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-2-news-api-endpoints (2026-06-21)

- **D1: Mock data expiry** — All `NEWS_DATA` items have hardcoded `published_at` dates around 2026-06-21; after 2026-06-28 the retention filter will silently return an empty list. Fix by anchoring mock dates relative to `datetime.now()` or using dynamic dates.
- **D2: `GET /categories` missing `response_model`** — The endpoint returns a raw dict with no Pydantic validation. Add a `CategoriesResponse` schema or `response_model=dict[str, list[str]]`.
- **D3: `GET /categories` / `GET /news/` category inconsistency** — `GET /categories` is built from full `NEWS_DATA` at import time; `GET /news/` filters by retention window. A category with only stale items appears in `/categories` but returns 0 items from `/news/`. Fix by computing categories dynamically from the retention-filtered dataset.
- **D4: "STORIES TODAY" widget misleading count** — `newsResponse.items.length` in `news/page.tsx` shows the filtered/paginated count (max 20), not actual stories published today. Rename label or add a `total` field to `NewsListResponse` pre-slice.
- **D5: "15 MIN REFRESH RATE" label mismatch** — `news/page.tsx` displays "15 MIN" but the actual ISR interval is 60 seconds (set in `fetchAPI`). Update the label to match reality.
- **D6: `NEWS_RETENTION_DAYS` module-level parse** — Parsed as `int(os.getenv(...))` at import time; tests cannot override the value without patching the module global. Migrate to Pydantic `BaseSettings` or a per-request `os.getenv()` call when test isolation becomes necessary.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-2-frontend-testing-infrastructure (2026-06-21)

- **D1: api.test.ts error assertion imprecise** — `toThrow('API error: 500')` is a substring match; the actual throw includes the path (`API error: 500 /news/`). The assertion will catch status-code regressions but not message-format changes. Tighten to `toThrow(/^API error: 500/)` when test precision is prioritised.
- **D2: AISummaryCard no edge-case data tests** — All four tests use a fully-populated `VALID_SUMMARY` fixture. Edge cases (empty `key_points: []`, empty `watch_sectors`, missing `set_range_low`/`set_range_high`) are untested. Add edge-case tests when AISummaryCard component is expected to be stable.
- **D3: TickerBar single-item doubling logic not tested** — The component doubles the items array for the CSS marquee; a single-item input should yield 2 DOM nodes. This doubling is untested. Add a test when TickerBar is confirmed stable.
- **D4: TickerBar zero-change boundary (change===0) not tested** — `change === 0` renders a `▲` arrow (positive branch). If the condition changes to `> 0`, the boundary flip goes undetected.
- **D5: Navbar non-root pathname active-tab path never tested** — Only `usePathname: () => '/'` is mocked, covering the Overview active state. No test verifies a different tab (e.g. `/news`) becomes active. Add when Navbar is stable.
- **D6: Coverage thresholds: only lines:80 enforced** — `branches`, `functions`, and `statements` thresholds are not configured. For a financial data app where conditional rendering (null analysis, featured flag, direction badges) is core behavior, branch coverage is more meaningful. Upgrade thresholds when the component suite is stable.
- **D7: Vitest alias manually duplicated from tsconfig** — `vitest.config.ts` manually mirrors the `@/*` alias from `tsconfig.json`. Consider adding `vite-tsconfig-paths` as a devDependency to auto-sync, eliminating the drift risk.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-9-about-disclaimer-page-and-wcag-accessibility-audit (2026-06-22)

- **D15: `prefers-reduced-motion` rule doesn't suppress CSS `animation:` properties** — `globals.css` media query uses `transition-duration: 0.01ms` which only affects CSS `transition:` properties; `.ticker-animate`, `.live-dot`, and Tailwind `animate-pulse` all use CSS `animation:` and remain active at full speed for users with `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`. AC3 spec text claimed coverage of "skeleton pulse" which is inaccurate. Fix: also add `animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;` to the media query. `frontend/src/app/globals.css`
- **D16: Footer JSX duplicated 5× across pages without a shared `<PageFooter />` component** — Identical footer HTML appears in `app/page.tsx`, `app/news/page.tsx`, `app/news/[id]/page.tsx`, `app/news/[id]/not-found.tsx`, `app/about/page.tsx`. Pre-existing in first two before this story. Extract to a `PageFooter` server component in a future cleanup story.

## Deferred from: code review of 2-8-home-page-layout-and-isr-configuration (2026-06-22)

- **D13: Duplicate non-functional search inputs on home page** — `page.tsx` renders a decorative `<input type="text" aria-label="Search news, stocks, sectors">` (line 106) inside `<main>`, while `NewsFeed` (rendered inside `<HomeFeedServer>`) renders its own `<input type="search">`. Two near-identical inert search controls appear on the home page; screen readers announce both. Pre-existing in old `page.tsx` before Story 2.8. Address in a dedicated search feature story or Story 2.9 WCAG audit. `frontend/src/app/page.tsx:106 + frontend/src/components/NewsFeed.tsx:38`
- **D14: `/trends` page calls `api.getMarketOverview()` without try/catch** — Unhandled rejection crashes the entire Trends page to the Next.js error boundary if the API is unavailable. Not introduced by Story 2.8; Story 2.8 hardened only `page.tsx`. Wrap in try/catch matching the pattern used in `MarketSidebarServer` in a future hardening story or during Story 2.9. `frontend/src/app/trends/page.tsx`

## Deferred from: code review of 2-7-news-detail-page (2026-06-22)

- **D8: 404 detection via string matching in NewsDetailServer** — `err.message.includes("404")` is coupled to the `fetchAPI` error format string "API error: 404 /news/<id>". If the error format changes, 404s silently become 500s. Fix: introduce a typed `ApiError` class with a `statusCode: number` property in `api.ts` and check `err.statusCode === 404`. `src/app/news/[id]/page.tsx:15`
- **D9: Ticker fetch sequential before Suspense boundary on detail page** — `api.getTicker()` is awaited before the JSX return, meaning the page renders nothing (not even a skeleton) while waiting for ticker data. Fix: extract ticker into its own Suspense boundary or use `Promise.allSettled` with the news fetch in the server component. Consistent with Story 2.6 pattern — fix both together. `src/app/news/[id]/page.tsx:31`
- **D10: Non-404 API errors in NewsDetailServer surface raw Next.js error page** — Only 404 errors are handled gracefully; any 5xx or network error re-throws and hits the nearest `error.tsx` boundary. AC3 specifies no raw error page, but was written for 404s specifically. Future story should add an `error.tsx` with a user-friendly fallback for the news detail route. `src/app/news/[id]/page.tsx:18`
- **D11: stock_impacts hidden when ai_analysis is null** — Deferred by PM: backend generates stock_impacts and ai_analysis together so stock_impacts is expected to be empty when ai_analysis is null. Revisit if backend produces direction badges independently. `src/components/NewsDetailContent.tsx:111`
- **D12: Analysis staleness (AC1 item 7) inside AIInsightBox rather than as separate post-SentimentBadge element** — Deferred by PM: staleness IS shown contextually inside the analysis box; full spec position 7 separation is a nice-to-have for future UX refinement. `src/components/NewsDetailContent.tsx:47`
