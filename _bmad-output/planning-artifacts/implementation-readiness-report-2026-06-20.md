# Implementation Readiness Assessment Report

**Date:** 2026-06-20
**Project:** ASK (Aware Signals & Knowledge)

## PRD Analysis

### Functional Requirements (29 total)

**News Aggregation (FR-N01–N06)**
- FR-N01: Collect news via n8n, every 30 min market hours / 2h outside (09:00–18:00 Bangkok)
- FR-N02: Non-nullable fields per item: headline, source name, source URL, pub timestamp (tz-aware), category tag, content body
- FR-N03: Exactly one category per item: Global Markets, Thai Stocks, Technology, Energy, Macroeconomics
- FR-N04: Deduplicate by URL and content hash
- FR-N05: Exclude items older than 7 days (configurable)
- FR-N06: Display "Last updated" timestamp; staleness warning if most recent item >60 min old during market hours

**AI Impact Analysis (FR-A01–A07)**
- FR-A01: Per article: 2–4 sentence summary, 0–3 affected sectors, 0–5 affected stocks/indices, sentiment ∈ {"bullish","bearish","neutral"}
- FR-A02: Analysis triggered within 5 minutes of ingestion (p90)
- FR-A03: "Analysis pending" state — article never hidden while analysis runs
- FR-A04: Non-removable disclaimer on every AI analysis surface: "AI-generated analysis is for informational purposes only and does not constitute investment advice."
- FR-A05: Sentiment typed as union at Pydantic, TypeScript, and UI — no freeform strings
- FR-A06: Analysis timestamp displayed; staleness indicator if >24h old
- FR-A07: Source headline + original article link always accompany analysis — never detached

**Market Trends (FR-T01–T04)**
- FR-T01: AI groups related articles into named themes: name, 2–3 sentence description, 2–8 constituent articles with individual analysis, overall sentiment
- FR-T02: Trends view ordered by recency of most recent constituent article
- FR-T03: Users can expand a theme card to see all constituent articles with AI summaries and sentiment
- FR-T04: Themes with no new articles in 48h are auto-archived and removed from Trends view

**Daily Brief (FR-D01–D05)**
- FR-D01: One brief per day: overall sentiment, 3–5 key developments, opportunities, risks
- FR-D02: Primary entry point on home page, rendered at top
- FR-D03: If today's brief not yet generated, show yesterday's with clear date label + "Today's brief is being prepared"
- FR-D04: Generated via n8n at configurable daily time (default 07:00 Bangkok / UTC+7)
- FR-D05: Include generation timestamp and disclaimer: "AI-generated market summary for informational purposes only. Not investment advice."

**Navigation & UX (FR-UX01–UX07)**
- FR-UX01: 4-section navigation: Home, News, Trends, About/Disclaimer
- FR-UX02: News filtering by 5 categories; default all categories sorted by publication time desc
- FR-UX03: List view per item: headline, source name, relative time, category tag, sentiment badge
- FR-UX04: green=bullish, red=bearish, gray=neutral — enforced at data layer, not CSS
- FR-UX05: Detail view: headline, source name + link, pub timestamp, AI summary, sectors, stocks, sentiment, analysis timestamp, disclaimer
- FR-UX06: ISR freshness contract (60s); visible staleness state when window exceeded
- FR-UX07: No silent/empty error states — explicit timestamped "data currently unavailable" messages

### Non-Functional Requirements (15 total)

**Performance**
- NFR-P01: Home page LCP < 2.5s on broadband desktop (Chrome)
- NFR-P02: News feed content refreshes via ISR within 60 seconds
- NFR-P03: AI analysis pipeline completes within 5 minutes at p90

**Reliability**
- NFR-R01: All n8n webhook FastAPI endpoints are idempotent (payload hash / event ID dedup)
- NFR-R02: Graceful degradation when AI pipeline is delayed — "Analysis pending" state, not an error
- NFR-R03: App remains usable if any single data category is unavailable

**Data Integrity**
- NFR-D01: Source attribution (name + URL) non-nullable at every pipeline layer
- NFR-D02: isFinite() guard on all numeric financial values before display formatting; NaN never in DOM
- NFR-D03: All API datetimes timezone-aware (UTC); frontend converts to Bangkok time (UTC+7)

**AI Output Standards**
- NFR-AI01: System prompt version-controlled as application code — not a runtime string
- NFR-AI02: Manual spot-check process before launch; target < 15% incorrect sentiment on 20-item sample

**Compliance**
- NFR-C01: Disclaimer on every AI-rendered surface — non-negotiable, no configuration override
- NFR-C02: About/Disclaimer page with: scope, data sources, AI limitations, no-investment-advice statement

**Accessibility**
- NFR-ACC01: WCAG 2.1 AA color contrast; sentiment color coding must have secondary non-color indicator

### Documented Assumptions (5)

1. News sources are RSS/API-based configured in n8n (specific source list = OQ-1, must-resolve before dev)
2. AI model is Claude, called via n8n; system prompt is a separate versioned deliverable
3. Thai ticker symbols follow SET conventions; supported ticker list = OQ-2
4. Theme generation triggered by n8n daily workflow (default 07:00 Bangkok)
5. Daily Brief draws from prior 24h of news/analysis; holiday/weekend handling = OQ-3

### Open Questions (6)

| # | Priority | Question |
|---|---|---|
| OQ-1 | Must resolve before dev | Which specific news sources are included at launch? |
| OQ-2 | Must resolve before AI pipeline | What is the supported SET ticker list? |
| OQ-3 | Should resolve before launch | How does the product handle market holidays and weekends? |
| OQ-4 | Should resolve before UX work | English only at launch, or Thai-language in scope? |
| OQ-5 | Should resolve before launch | Does MVP require any user authentication? |
| OQ-6 | Can defer | Intended monetization model? |

### PRD Completeness Assessment

The PRD is well-structured with complete FR and NFR coverage for the MVP scope. Two open questions (OQ-1, OQ-2) are flagged as **must-resolve before development** — these affect n8n workflow design and AI prompt validation respectively. All other OQs are post-MVP or launch decisions that do not block implementation.

## UX Alignment Assessment

### UX Document Status

Found — two peer contract spines, both `status: final`, dated 2026-06-20:
- `DESIGN.md` (visual identity — color tokens, typography, component visual specs, do's and don'ts)
- `EXPERIENCE.md` (behavioral — IA, component behavior, state patterns, accessibility floor, key flows)

Supporting artifacts present: `review-accessibility.md`, `review-compliance.md`, `review-rubric.md` — formal three-lens validation performed during UX workflow.

### UX ↔ PRD Alignment

| PRD Concern | UX Coverage | Status |
|---|---|---|
| UJ-1: Nam's morning brief (Daily Brief, 8 min session) | Key Flow 1 — fully mapped in EXPERIENCE.md with named protagonist | ✓ Aligned |
| UJ-2: Lek's impact check (category filter, mobile) | Key Flow 2 — Energy category filtering, mobile layout, sentiment on card | ✓ Aligned |
| UJ-3: Wanida's sector sweep (Trends, Thai stocks) | Key Flow 3 — Theme card list → Theme Detail with Thai ticker display | ✓ Aligned |
| 4-section nav (FR-UX01) | IA shows Home / News / Stocks (Trends) / About — 4 sections | ⚠️ See note below |
| Category filtering (FR-UX02) | Category Filter Bar specified in EXPERIENCE.md — 5 categories + URL param | ✓ Aligned |
| NewsCard fields (FR-UX03) | NewsCard scan order specified with all required fields | ✓ Aligned |
| Non-removable disclaimer (FR-A04) | Explicitly marked as structural in DailyBriefCard, News Detail, Theme Detail | ✓ Aligned |
| WCAG 2.1 AA (NFR-ACC01) | Accessibility floor section covers focus ring, ARIA, contrast, motion | ✓ Aligned |
| English primary, Thai subtitles | Foundation states: English primary, Thai as identity marker (aria-hidden on sub-labels) | ✓ Aligned |

**⚠️ Nav Label Note (non-blocking):** EXPERIENCE.md line 70 documents a naming discrepancy: the nav item is labeled "Stocks / หุ้น" in the existing codebase, but maps to the "Trends" capability in the PRD. The UX spine explicitly flags this as needing user confirmation before launch. Stories 5.2 and the Trends page use the `/trends` route and "Market Trends" H1 — only the nav label itself is ambiguous.

### UX ↔ Architecture Alignment

| Architecture Decision | UX Requirement | Status |
|---|---|---|
| ISR 60s revalidate | EXPERIENCE.md Foundation explicitly references "ISR with 60s revalidate on all feed endpoints" | ✓ Aligned |
| Server Components by default | EXPERIENCE.md Foundation: "Server Components by default" | ✓ Aligned |
| Tailwind v3 design tokens | DESIGN.md tokens map 1:1 to `tailwind.config.ts` (17 tokens, all synced) | ✓ Aligned |
| No database in MVP | Architecture doc and EXPERIENCE.md both acknowledge in-memory/mock — no UX component depends on DB features | ✓ Aligned |
| No auth | No UX surface requires login state, personalization, or user-scoped views | ✓ Aligned |
| LCP < 2.5s (NFR-P01) | EXPERIENCE.md requires Suspense boundaries on every async component; no client-side data fetching on initial load | ✓ Aligned |
| n8n webhook-only | No UX surface implies bidirectional or real-time connection — all UX is read-only with ISR freshness | ✓ Aligned |

### Warnings

1. **Nav label "Stocks" vs "Trends" (low severity):** The nav tab wording in the existing codebase says "Stocks" but the PRD, epics, and routes all say "Trends." EXPERIENCE.md explicitly flags this for confirmation before launch. Not a blocker for Epic implementation, but should be decided before the /trends page ships in Epic 5.

### Overall UX Alignment

Strong. Both spines are complete, validated, and directly referenced by the epics. All three user journeys are mapped. All FR-level UX requirements have corresponding component specs. The single discrepancy (nav label) is pre-acknowledged in the UX documentation itself.

---

## Epic Quality Review

### Validation Methodology
Each epic assessed against: user-value focus, independence, story sizing, forward-dependency absence, AC testability, and brownfield compliance.

---

### Epic 1 — Development Foundation & Quality Infrastructure

**User value focus:** ⚠️ Technical by nature. "Development Foundation" names a technical milestone, not a user outcome.
**Verdict — Minor, Justified:** This is a brownfield project with confirmed missing test infrastructure (documented in `architecture.md`). Without Vitest and pytest in place, every subsequent story's acceptance criteria cannot be verified. In this context, an explicit foundation epic is the correct pattern — not an anti-pattern. The same reasoning applies to greenfield projects that lack CI/CD before feature work begins.

**Epic independence:** Standalone — has no upstream epic dependency. ✓

**Story dependency flow:**
- 1.1 (test infra): standalone ✓
- 1.2 (env/CORS validation): builds on 1.1 having established a working test harness ✓

**Database/entity timing:** No schemas created in Epic 1. ✓
**Starter template:** Not applicable — codebase already bootstrapped. ✓
**Brownfield check:** Correctly identifies what is missing (test infra, env validation) without re-initializing existing code. ✓

---

### Epic 2 — Core News Feed & Reading Experience

**User value focus:** Strong — delivers the complete news reading experience. Users can browse, filter, and read AI-analyzed articles. ✓

**Epic independence:** Depends on Epic 1 (test harness must exist to verify ACs). Operates on mock data — does not require Epic 3 (live pipeline) to function. ✓

**Story dependency flow:**
- 2.1 (schema) → 2.2 (API uses schema types) → 2.3 (layout shell, parallel-capable but sequenced correctly) → 2.4 (shared components using types from 2.1) → 2.5 (NewsCard uses 2.4 components) → 2.6 (feed page uses 2.5 + 2.2) → 2.7 (detail page uses 2.5 + 2.2) → 2.8 (home page uses 2.3 + 2.2) → 2.9 (audit covers all prior work) ✓

**Potential overlap — Stories 2.3 and 2.8:** 2.3 builds the Navbar/layout shell; 2.8 wires ISR, Suspense, and placeholder sidebar. These are complementary, not duplicated — 2.3 is structural, 2.8 is behavioral/caching. ✓

**Note on "developer" stories:** Stories 2.1, and similar schema stories in later epics, use "As a developer" voice. This is appropriate for infrastructure stories that are necessary prerequisites for user-facing work. All such stories in the set are correctly ordered first within their epic.

**AC quality:** All 9 stories use Given/When/Then format throughout. Error conditions are explicitly covered (422 for invalid inputs, 404 for missing resources, staleness banner, empty state, pending state). ✓

---

### Epic 3 — News & AI Analysis Ingestion Pipeline

**User value focus:** Indirect but genuine — transitions the platform from mock data to a live, self-updating product. Without this epic, the user sees test fixtures; after it, they see real news. ✓

**Epic independence:** Depends on Epic 2 (GET /api/news/{id} endpoint from Story 2.2 is referenced in Story 3.2's post-delivery verification). Epic 3 introduces new POST webhook routes — it does not modify Epic 2 routes. Dependency is one-directional and correctly sequenced. ✓

**Story dependency flow:**
- 3.1 (news ingestion webhook) → 3.2 (AI analysis webhook references news_id from 3.1 records) → 3.3 (system prompt, independent but sequenced after the webhook boundary is established) → 3.4 (n8n config validates end-to-end, requires 3.1 + 3.2 endpoints) ✓

**Idempotency:** Correctly specified in Stories 3.1 and 3.2 with explicit retry simulation in ACs. ✓

**System prompt (Story 3.3):** Appropriately scoped — file existence test + constraint phrase assertions. Testable. ✓

---

### Epic 4 — Daily Market Brief

**User value focus:** Strong — delivers UJ-1 (Nam's morning brief). Directly measurable: D1 retention is a PRD success metric. ✓

**Epic independence:** Depends on Epic 2 (home page layout from Story 2.8, navigation from Story 2.3). Does NOT depend on Epic 3 (the Daily Brief has its own webhook pathway independent of news ingestion). A brief could be generated and displayed before any news ingestion is wired. ✓

**Story dependency flow:**
- 4.1 (schema + API) → 4.2 (component, uses DailyBrief type from 4.1) → 4.3 (webhook, pushes data to endpoint from 4.1) → 4.4 (home page integration, uses component from 4.2) ✓

**Fallback state (FR-D03):** Correctly modeled as `is_fallback: boolean` in schema rather than a nullable or optional field — ensures the frontend always has a typed signal, never guesses. ✓

**Documentation gap:** Epic 4 (and 5, 6) epic summaries in `epics.md` do not list `NFRs covered:` unlike Epics 2 and 3. The story ACs themselves are complete, but the epic-level summary is inconsistent. **Minor documentation gap.**

---

### Epic 5 — Market Trends & Themes

**User value focus:** Strong — delivers UJ-3 (Wanida's sector sweep). Theme detail with Thai stock tickers is the key differentiator for the Thai retail investor segment. ✓

**Epic independence:** Depends on Epics 2 (NewsCard component used in Story 5.3) and 3 (news items must exist for theme constituent validation). Both are correctly prior epics. ✓

**Story dependency flow:**
- 5.1 (schema + API, 48h filter at query time) → 5.2 (ThemeCard + Trends page uses MarketThemeSummary type) → 5.3 (Theme Detail page uses MarketTheme + NewsCard from Epic 2) → 5.4 (webhook validates against existing news items) ✓

**48h filter — design decision:** Applied at query time (not via background job). Correct for an MVP with in-memory data — no cron job infrastructure is needed. The `HTTP 410 Gone` response for archived themes (Story 5.1, 5.3) is a correct semantic choice that distinguishes "archived" from "never existed." ✓

**FR-T03 vs Theme Detail page:** The PRD says "expand a theme card" but the UX spec implements this as navigation to a detail page. EXPERIENCE.md explicitly notes the click behavior (`/trends/[id]`). This is a deliberate UX decision, not a gap — the PRD's intent (see all constituent articles with AI summaries) is fully satisfied by the detail page. ✓

---

### Epic 6 — Market Context Widgets

**User value focus:** Strong — adds live market context (ticker, indices, sectors, trends summary) that was present as placeholder cards in Story 2.8. Directly supports the research companion positioning. ✓

**Epic independence:** Depends on Epics 2–5. TrendSummary reads from GET /api/trends (Epic 5). MarketOverviewWidget and SectorHeatmap use new endpoints from Story 6.1 within this epic. ✓

**Story dependency flow:**
- 6.1 (schema + API + webhooks) → 6.2 (TickerBar uses MarketSnapshot from 6.1) → 6.3 (MarketOverviewWidget uses MarketSnapshot from 6.1) → 6.4 (SectorHeatmap uses SectorPerformance from 6.1) → 6.5 (TrendSummary + sidebar composition, requires 6.2/6.3/6.4 components and Epic 5 GET /api/trends) ✓

**`isFinite()` guard:** Explicitly required in Stories 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4 for `price`, `change_pct`, and `value`. Consistent with NFR-D02 and the project-context.md rules. ✓

**TickerBar `aria-hidden`:** Story 6.2 correctly marks the ticker bar as `aria-hidden="true"` (decorative) since the same index data is accessible in structured form via MarketOverviewWidget. This is the correct WCAG pattern. ✓

---

### Best Practices Compliance Summary

| Epic | User Value | Independence | No Fwd Deps | AC Quality | DB Timing | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | ⚠️ Technical (justified) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass with note |
| 2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
| 3 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
| 4 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
| 5 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |
| 6 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Pass |

### Findings by Severity

**🔴 Critical Violations:** None.

**🟠 Major Issues:** None.

**🟡 Minor Concerns:**
1. **Epic 1 technical naming** — "Development Foundation" is not user-facing. Justified by brownfield context and architecture mandate. No change required, but implementation agents should understand this is infra, not a feature epic.
2. **NFR coverage missing from Epic 4/5/6 summaries** — Epic summaries for Epics 4, 5, and 6 do not include an explicit `NFRs covered:` line (unlike Epics 2 and 3). Individual story ACs are complete. This is a documentation inconsistency, not a coverage gap.
3. **Nav label "Stocks" vs "Trends"** — pre-acknowledged in EXPERIENCE.md. Decide before Epic 5 ships.
4. **OQ-1 and OQ-2 are must-resolve blockers** — the specific news source list (OQ-1) and SET ticker list (OQ-2) are flagged in the PRD as "must resolve before development" and "must resolve before AI pipeline" respectively. No story can be unblocked by these, but n8n workflow configuration (Story 3.4) and AI prompt design (Story 3.3) will need these answers to be finalized.

---

## Summary and Recommendations

### Overall Readiness Status

**READY** for Epic 1 and Epic 2 — implementation can begin immediately.

**CONDITIONALLY READY** for Epics 3–6 — two pre-implementation decisions (OQ-1, OQ-2) must be resolved before Epic 3 work begins. All other planning artifacts are complete and implementation-ready.

### Issue Register

| # | Severity | Category | Issue | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 🟡 Minor | Epic Structure | Epic 1 title is technical-facing ("Development Foundation"), not user-centric | No — justified by brownfield architecture mandate |
| 2 | 🟡 Minor | Documentation | Epic 4/5/6 summaries missing explicit `NFRs covered:` line (story ACs are complete) | No — cosmetic only |
| 3 | 🟡 Minor | UX/Nav | Nav label "Stocks" in codebase vs "Trends" in PRD/routes | No — pre-acknowledged; decide before Epic 5 ships |
| 4 | 🟡 Minor | Open Questions | OQ-1: News source list not yet defined | Yes — blocks Story 3.4 (n8n workflow config) |
| 5 | 🟡 Minor | Open Questions | OQ-2: SET ticker list not yet defined | Yes — blocks Story 3.3 (system prompt finalization) |

**Total issues: 5 — all minor. No critical or major issues identified.**

### Recommended Next Steps

1. **Resolve OQ-1 (news sources) before Epic 3 begins.** Curate the specific RSS/API feeds (Reuters, Bangkok Post, SET announcements, etc.) that n8n will poll. This directly determines Story 3.4's n8n workflow design and the scope of Story 3.1's accepted `source` values.

2. **Resolve OQ-2 (SET ticker list) before Story 3.3 is worked.** Define the reference list of supported Thai SET ticker symbols that the AI system prompt will use for `affected_stocks` validation. Without this, the system prompt constraint (FR-A01: 0–5 affected stocks using standard ticker symbols) cannot be verified against a known reference.

3. **Confirm the nav label decision before Epic 5 begins.** Choose between "Trends" (aligned with PRD, routes, and epics content) and "Stocks" (current codebase label). Update the Navbar bilingual label in Story 2.3 or defer to a Story 5.2 change. Either is fine — it just needs a decision.

4. **Begin implementation with Epic 1, Story 1.1.** The testing infrastructure (Vitest + RTL frontend; pytest + pytest-asyncio backend) is the confirmed first deliverable. All 26 stories have acceptance criteria that require a working test harness.

5. **Add NFR coverage lines to Epic 4/5/6 summaries in `epics.md`.** Optional but improves traceability for future maintainers.

### Final Note

This assessment reviewed 5 planning artifacts (PRD, Architecture, DESIGN.md, EXPERIENCE.md, epics.md) against 29 FRs, 14 NFRs, 25 UX-DRs, and 26 stories across 6 epics.

**What is strong:** FR/NFR coverage is 100%. All user journeys (UJ-1, UJ-2, UJ-3) are fully mapped from PRD through UX spines through story-level acceptance criteria. No forward dependencies exist between stories. No critical or major quality violations were found. The compliance-critical requirements (non-removable disclaimers, isFinite guards, AwareDatetime enforcement, idempotent webhooks, sentiment union types) are addressed explicitly in story ACs across every relevant epic.

**What to resolve first:** Two open questions from the PRD (OQ-1 and OQ-2) are the only genuine blockers, and only for Epic 3 onwards. Epics 1 and 2 can begin today.
